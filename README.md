## üö¶ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Not Starting**
   - Ensure you're in the `mcp-ui-server` directory
   - Run `npm run build` before `npm start`
   - Check for TypeScript compilation errors

2. **Anthropic API Errors**
   - Verify your API key in `.env.local`
   - Check API key permissions and credits
   - Ensure network connectivity

3. **Template Not Rendering**
   - Check if template component exists in `components/templates/`
   - Verify template type is registered in `dynamic-template.tsx`
   - Look for console errors in browser developer tools

## ü§ù How It Works

The system consists of two main components:

1. **MCP Server** (`mcp-ui-server/`): A TypeScript server that implements the Model Context Protocol to generate UI template configurations with realistic data
2. **Next.js Chatbot** (`/`): A React application with Anthropic Claude integration that provides a conversational interface for template generation

The chatbot uses Claude Sonnet to understand user requests and translate them into MCP tool calls, which generate rich UI templates that are then rendered as React components.
